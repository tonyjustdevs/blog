    "# 2. Gaussian Noise\n",
    "\n",
    "`Gaussian noise`, also known as normal noise, has several properties that make it a commonly used type of noise in various applications (including machine learning).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.1 Statistical Properties\n",
    "- Gaussian noise is characterized by a `normal distribution`, which is well-studied and has known statistical properties. \n",
    "- This makes it easy to model and analyze mathematically.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.2 Central Limit Theorem:\n",
    "- The `Central Limit Theorem` states that the sum (or average) of a large number of independent, identically distributed random variables, each with finite mean and variance, will be approximately normally distributed. \n",
    "- This property makes Gaussian noise a natural choice in many scenarios where the noise is a result of multiple independent factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.3 Mathematical Simplicity:\n",
    "- The normal distribution has simple and well-defined mathematical properties, making it easy to work with in `analytical` and `computational` contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.4 Robustness in Estimation:\n",
    "- Many statistical estimation methods, including `maximum likelihood estimation`, assume that the underlying noise follows a Gaussian distribution. \n",
    "- This can lead to more robust parameter estimates when the actual noise is close to Gaussian.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.5 Convenient in Machine Learning:\n",
    "- In machine learning, adding Gaussian noise can act as a form of regularization, preventing overfitting by introducing a controlled amount of randomness during training. It is also commonly used in generative models, such as `Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs)`."

    "\n",
    "- Adding random noise to the input data can act as a form of regularization, preventing the model from fitting the training data too closely. \n",
    "- This can improve the generalization of the model to new, unseen data.\n",
    "- Models that are too complex may memorize the training data instead of learning the underlying patterns. \n",

    "\n",
    "- Adding noise during training can make the model more robust to variations and uncertainties in real-world data. \n",
