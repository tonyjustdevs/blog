    "- I created a repo [tonyjustdevs/learning_csharp](https://github.com/tonyjustdevs/learning_csharp) via wsl (I did this for all my repos so far).\n",
    "- Then I manually (and painstakingly) decomposed the course [Foundational C# with Microsoft](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/foundational-c-sharp-with-microsoft/) into 8 Parts.\n",
    "    - I mass copied the whole page above and then created an issue (to have an outline of the course on gh)\n",
    "    - Each part has about of 7-8 units, so I created issues for each part via the `Github PR: Issues Extension` in VSC. \n",
    "        Each unit was a dot point prefixed with `- [ ]` so when it appears in the issue description, it is automatically a github task. \n",
    "        - (I like converting lists into tasks because Github makes it pretty with a counter for each task etc)\n",
    "    - [A previous post introduces how I setup GH-API via Python](https://tonyjustdevs.github.io/blog/posts/notes/coding/11-github-api.html)\n",
    "    - I then ran a python script that converts all tasks into  issue description to be into new individual issues (This is like pressing the circle that post up when you hover your mouse over a task).\n",
    "        - Since I have had parts, I ran this for each of the 7 Parts.\n",
    "- After this, I began the course and quickly realised I wanted to focus on building c# applications with Visual Studio not Visual Studio Code\n",
    "    - No other reason beyond already being familiar with VSC and wanting to learn a new IDE and\n",
    "    - VS isn't a bad option for C# ðŸ˜…\n",
    "- I also want to keep the original repo for when I build apps with wsl and vsc, so I created a new repo c# app I built with **Visual Studio**: [tonyjustdevs/learning_csharp_vs](https://github.com/tonyjustdevs/learning_csharp_vs)\n",
    "- At first, I clicked the transfer issue button on the Github website, which is fine. But I figured, this isn't what a software engineer would do. So lets use the api to do it."
