    "## 3.1 Regularization and Preventing Memorization:\n",
    "`Avoid and  Discouraging Overfitting`: \n",
    "- Adding random noise to the input data can act as a form of regularization, preventing the model from fitting the training data too closely. \n",
    "- This can improve the generalization of the model to new, unseen data.\n",
    "- Models that are too complex may memorize the training data instead of learning the underlying patterns. \n",
    "- Adding noise makes it more challenging for the model to memorize specific examples and encourages it to focus on general patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.2 Data Augmentation:\n",
    "`Increased Variability`: \n",
    "- Introducing noise during training can artificially increase the variability in the dataset. \n",
    "- This can be particularly useful when dealing with limited training data, helping the model generalize better to different variations of the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.3 Robustness Testing:\n",
    "`Model Robustness`: \n",
    "- Adding noise during training can make the model more robust to variations and uncertainties in real-world data. \n",
    "- This is especially important when the model needs to perform well on data that may have different levels of noise or unexpected variations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.4 Stochasticity in Training:\n",
    "`Encouraging Exploration`: \n",
    "- During the training process, introducing randomness can encourage the model to explore different parts of the parameter space. \n",
    "- This can be especially beneficial in reinforcement learning or optimization problems, helping to avoid getting stuck in local minima.\n"
