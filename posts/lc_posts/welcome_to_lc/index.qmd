1. Created new `leetcode.qmd` based on front page `index.qmd` and  
2. Directed contents to point here: `contents: posts/lc_posts`.

Probably not the ideal blog + folder structure but it'll do the job👌.  
I don't claim to be a web-designer in any sense 😂. 

I began 3 months ago with no algorithm or data structures academic background at all. The Easys were definitey not Easy to me as you can see from the number of submissions.

The majority of submissions were 2-3 months ago and I made no attempts in January 2024 👏.

This page should keep me accountable and these fingers minty as a mojito on a hot day 🍹.
