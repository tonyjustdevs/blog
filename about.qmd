About Tony

This is a blog to note down my learning journey. Perhaps it can help others too.


Poem of Oreo  

In a bustling town of Ultimo, where city lights gleam,  
A tale unfolds of Oreo, a kitten’s sweet dream.  
Tony brought him home with Lilo by his side,  
A tuxedo cat, in black and white pride.  

Oreo, a Maine Coon with a fluffy coat,  
Black all over, with white around his throat.  
White paws that dance, a playful delight,  
A mischievous gleam in his eyes, shining bright.  

Lilo, a tiny British Shorthair so fair,  
A dainty companion with a gentle air.  
They grew up together, a dynamic pair,  
From Ultimo to Pyrmont, a journey to share.  

Through the streets of Townhall, they explored,  
Adventures aplenty, their spirits soared.  
Yet, runaway moments were a frequent feat,  
Found and embraced, their connection so sweet.  

Oreo, a rogue, with a penchant for bins,  
A greedy delight, where the treasure begins.  
Feasting on scraps, his appetite vast,  
But his cuteness prevails, a spell he has cast.  

Lilo, petite, with a modest cuisine,  
A nibble here, a delicate routine.  
She watches Oreo with curious eyes,  
As he plays around, chasing butterflies.  

In the city’s heartbeat, their story unfolds,  
Through alleys and parks, where the tale molds.  
Oreo, the player, with antics so grand,  
Lilo, the watcher, in the city so grand.  

Now, in the world of influencers and fame,  
Oreo has found his claim to the game.  
An influencer cat, with followers galore,  
From bins to glamour, a journey to adore.  

Through Ultimo, Pyrmont, and Townhall’s embrace,  
Oreo and Lilo found their special place.  
A tale of friendship, of mischief and grace,  
In the city’s heartbeat, a memory to trace.
